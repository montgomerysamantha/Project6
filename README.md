# Prime Breadth First Search
Given two prime numbers, this program uses a graph data structure and Breadth First Search to locate a "path"
between the prime numbers, with the generated path consisting of only prime numbers and only one digit is allowed to be changed per step.
The algorithm is working to transform one prime number into another, step-by-step, one digit at a time essentially.

Primes are found and generated by using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

Tip: make sure the selected number of digits matches the number of digits that your primes have.
